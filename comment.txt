Books are not made of words and pages. They are made of dreams, hopes and possibilities!!!
Between the pages of a book is a lovely place to be.
Every secret of a writer's soul, every experience of his life, every quality of his mind, is written large in his works.
The first draft is just you telling yourself the story. Write, you'll get better!!!
And by the way, everything in life is writable about if you have the outgoing guts to do it, and the imagination to improvise. The worst enemy to creativity is self-doubt.
